- 👋 Hi, I’m @LarryOgle
- 👀 I’m interested in wireless communication with Arduino (and other micros) using nRF24L01 transceiver radios bi-directionally to control train traffic between yard sections on the Orange County Model Engineers track.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning multipoint communication between 3 and 4 Arduinos.  Control of signal LED's with I2C parallel output controllers.  Implementaion of track detection sensors via I2C.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on designing and implementing automated train track control via Arduinos in a similar manor that existed in railroad signal control towers. 
- 📫 How to reach me @ oglerail@gmail.com with note stating GitHub reference in the subject line.
- 😄 Pronouns: Nah.
- ⚡ Fun fact: ...
